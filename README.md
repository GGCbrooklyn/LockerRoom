Guide to deploy:

Initial Guide:

* cd into ~/LockerRoom/Gymbackend
* type bundle
* If you receive an error you may have to gem install individual gems or even brew install pg
* type bundle update (just to be sure)
* If everything is good type rake db:migrate db:seed
* This will take a while because we are seeding a lot of data that is filtered thoroughly.

Next:

* cd into ~/LockerRoom/GymBackend/app/assets/javascripts
* type: mkdir libraries
* cd libraries
* curl -O http://backbonejs.org/backbone.js
* curl -O http://underscorejs.org/underscore.js

You now have all of the dependencies for the code. You may choose to rails s from ~/LockerRoom/GymBackend or if on digital ocean/heroku:

* cd ~/LockerRoom/GymBackend
* puma server -p80
* Enter your IP address into a browser and enjoy!
